# About

This is an inventory app for "Go Climb Rocks", a fictive shop specializing in rock climbing equipment!

It is built with Node.js and Express, and Pug as the template engine.
MongoDB is used as the database for this project, and the app is hosted on Railway.
The styling was done with Bootstrap, yet it was kept to the usual minimalistic nature of inventory apps.

Check it out live on [Railway](inventory-app-production-56a9.up.railway.app)!
